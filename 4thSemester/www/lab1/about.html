                        <h2>Short description of my interests</h2>
                        <p>Hi, I'm Michał and I am a second year student of Algorithmic Computer Science at Wrocław University of Science and Technology. I'm from Poland and currently live close to the city in which I'm studying.</p>
                        <p>
                            My scientific interests mainly revolve around Math and Computer Science. My probably favorite 
                            branch of mathematics is <a href="numbertheory.html">Number Theory</a>, although I also enjoy problems involving sums and integrals. 
                            My more mathematical way of thinking makes me prefer understanding fundamental ideas behind things I use,
                            as opposed to jumping staight into move 'advanced' concepts, which resulted in me liking <a href="lowlevel.html">low level programming</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>On this site you can also find a short description of a few of my <a href="projects.html">programming projects.</a></p>
                        <p>My non-scientific intrests include reading, especially fantasy, and recently I've taken a liking to bouldering.</p>
